bubblephant
===========

Help your flying elephant collect as many bubbles as he can! But be careful of not hitting the walls. First C++/SDL try in a very long time.

# How to play
To keep your elephant flying, press with your mouse. The elephant will try and come to your mouse position. Press too long and he'll hit the walls. Press too far and he'll hit the walls.
If you hit a wall, you are reset.

# Goal
Touch as many bubbles as you can!
